Here is an example of a text-based simulation on the topic of growing a pea:
```python
# grow-pea.py
# based on refridgerate-food.py
### peter jansen (feb 15/2023)

# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to grow a pea.
# Environment: garden
# Task-critical Objects: Pea, FlowerPot, Jug, Sink, Water
# High-level object classes: Device (Sink), Container (FlowerPot, Jug, Sink)
# Critical properties: stage (Pea), water (Pea)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, turn on/off device, pour water into container
# Distractor Items: None
# Distractor Actions: use X on Y
# High-level solution procedure: take pea seed, put pea in flower pot, use the jug to water the pea on time until the pea grows to the reproducing stage

This code is a simulation of growing a pea, where the player must take a pea seed, put it in a flower pot, and use a jug to water the pea until it grows to the reproducing stage. The player must also make sure the pea is not spoiled by keeping it in a cool environment. The game is won if the pea grows to the reproducing stage, and lost if the pea is spoiled or missing.

The code includes a class for the pea, flower pot, jug, sink, and water, as well as a class for the agent (the player) and the world. The game also includes a score and a game over flag. The game is won if the pea grows to the reproducing stage, and lost if the pea is spoiled or missing.

The game also includes a function for generating possible actions, and a function for interpreting actions. The possible actions include looking around, examining objects, taking objects, putting objects in containers, turning on/off devices, and using devices on objects. The game also includes a function for calculating the score, which is based on the number of peas grown and the number of peas missing.

The game also includes a main program that runs the game, and a function for printing the current game state. The game is won if the pea grows to the reproducing stage, and lost if the pea is spoiled or missing.
