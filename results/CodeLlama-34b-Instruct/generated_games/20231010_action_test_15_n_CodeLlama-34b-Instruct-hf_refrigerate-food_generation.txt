Here is an example of a text-based simulation on the topic of keeping warm and navigating to another house in a cold winter day:
```python
# keep_warm.py
# based on refridgerate-food.py
### peter jansen (feb 15/2023)

# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to keep warm, go outside and navigate to another house in a cold winter day
# Environment: world
# Task-critical Objects: Room, Clothes
# High-level object classes: Container (Room)
# Critical properties: cold (Room), cold_resistance (Clothes), warmth (Agent)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, put on clothes, move
# Distractor Items: Clothes, Room
# Distractor Actions: None
# High-level solution procedure: take down coat, put on down coat, move outside, find a way to another house

This code is a text-based simulation that models how to keep warm and navigate to another house in a cold winter day. The player must take down their coat, put on a down coat, move outside, and find a way to another house. The player must also keep warm by putting on clothes to keep warm. The player must also navigate to another house.

The code includes a class for the game object, a class for the agent, and a class for the world. The game object class includes functions for generating possible actions, interpreting actions, and calculating the score. The agent class includes functions for displaying the inventory and putting on clothes. The world class includes functions for generating the world, getting the task description, and calculating the score.

The code also includes classes for the room, clothes, and agent. The room class includes functions for decreasing the temperature of anything inside the room, and the clothes class includes functions for getting a list of referents and making a human-readable string that describes the clothes. The agent class includes functions for getting a list of referents and making a human-readable string that describes the agent.

The code also includes a main program that creates a new game, gets a list of valid actions, and performs the action. The main program also includes a while loop that runs until the game is over.

This code is a good starting point for creating a text-based simulation that models how to keep warm and navigate to another house in a cold winter day. It includes functions for generating possible actions, interpreting actions, and calculating the score. It also includes classes for the game object, agent, and world.
