Here is an example of a text-based simulation on the topic of grilling food, using the specifications provided:
```python
# grill-food.py
# based on bath-tub-water-temperature.py
# ruoyao wang (april 4/25/2023)

# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to grill food.
# Environment: backyard
# Task-critical Objects: Grill, Food, Salt, Oil
# High-level object classes: Device (Grill), Container (Grill, Food) 
# Critical properties: is_grilled (Food)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, turn on/off device, add salt/oil to food, grill food, eat food
# Distractor Items: Food
# Distractor Actions: None
# High-level solution procedure: take food, add salt/oil to food based on task description, turn on grill, put food on grill, wait till food is cooked, eat food

This code is a text-based simulation that models how to grill food. The player must take food, add salt and oil to it, turn on the grill, put the food on the grill, wait till the food is cooked, and then eat the food. The player can also look around the environment, examine objects, take objects, put objects in containers, turn on/off devices, and use devices on objects. The game is over when the player eats the food, and the player wins if the food is grilled.

Note that this code is just an example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific needs. Additionally, you may want to add more objects and actions to the game to make it more challenging and interesting.
