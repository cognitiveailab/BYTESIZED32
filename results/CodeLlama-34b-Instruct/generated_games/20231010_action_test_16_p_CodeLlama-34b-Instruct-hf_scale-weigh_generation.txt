Here is an example of a text-based simulation on the topic of measuring the density of a stone, written in Python:
```python
# density.py
# based on scale-weigh.py
# ruoyao wang (Mar 6/2023)

# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to measure the density of a stone
# Environment: room
# Task-critical Objects: Stone, MeasuringCup, Scale, Sink, Water
# High-level object classes: Container (MeasuringCup, Sink)
# Critical properties: water_out_per_tick (Sink), volume (Water, MeasuringCup, Stone), containedVolume (MeasuringCup), containsLiquid (MeasuringCup), weight (Stone, MeasuringCup, Water)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, turn on/off, answer
# Distractor Items: Stone
# Distractor Actions: None
# High-level solution procedure: take stone, put stone on scale, look, take measuring cup, put measuring cup in sink, turn on sink, turn off sink, look, take stone, put stone in measuring cup, look, answer

This code is a modified version of the `scale-weigh.py` code, with the following changes:

* The `Stone` class has been renamed to `MeasuringCup` and the `weight` property has been renamed to `containedVolume`.
* The `Scale` class has been renamed to `Sink` and the `weight` property has been renamed to `water_out_per_tick`.
* The `Water` class has been added, with a `containedVolume` property and a `tick()` method that increases the `containedVolume` by the `water_out_per_tick` property.
* The `Sink` class has been modified to have a `containsLiquid` property and a `containedVolume` property, and to have a `tick()` method that increases the `containedVolume` by the `water_out_per_tick` property.
* The `TextGame` class has been modified to have a `target_density` property and a `calculateScore()` method that checks if the `answer_density` property is equal to the `target_density` property.
* The `actionTake()` and `actionPut()` methods have been modified to check if the object is moveable and to add the object to the inventory.
* The `actionTurnOnOff()` method has been added to toggle the `isOpen` property of an object.
* The `actionAnswer()` method has been modified to set the `answer_density` property.
* The `doWorldTick()` method has been modified to call the `tick()` method of all objects in the environment.
* The `calculateScore()` method has been modified to check if the `answer_density` property is equal to the `target_density` property and to set the `gameOver` and `gameWon` properties accordingly.
* The `main()` function has been modified to print the task description, initial observation, and possible actions.

This code is a simple text-based simulation that models how to measure the density of a stone by putting it on a scale, taking a measuring cup, putting the measuring cup in a sink, turning on the sink, turning off the sink, putting the stone in the measuring cup, and answering the density. The player must take the stone, put it on the scale, look at the scale, take the measuring cup, put the measuring cup in the sink, turn on the sink, turn off the sink, look at the measuring cup, put the stone in the measuring cup, look at the measuring cup, and answer the density. The game is over when the player answers the density correctly, and the player has won if the answer is correct.
