# based on volume-stone.py
# ruoyao wang (apr 28/2023)

# Task Description: Your task is to simulate an experiment that measures the area of a paper by a ruler.
# Environment: room
# Task-critical Objects: Paper, Ruler
# High-level object classes: None
# Critical properties: length (Paper), width (Paper)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, measure object with ruler, answer
# Distractor Items: None
# Distractor Actions: None
# High-level solution procedure: take ruler, measure length of paper, measure width of paper, answer
