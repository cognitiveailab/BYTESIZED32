Here is an example of a text-based simulation on the topic of adding water to a pot using a measuring cup:
```python
# add_water.py
# based on add_water.py
# ruoyao wang (mar 05/2023)

# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to add certain amount of water into a pot using a measuring cup.
# Environment: kitchen
# Task-critical Objects: Sink, MeasuringCup, Pot, Water
# High-level object classes: Device (Sink), Container (Sink, MeasuringCup, Pot) 
# Critical properties: volume (Water), max_volume (MeasuringCup, Pot), contained_volume (MeasuringCup, Pot)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, pour liquid into container
# Distractor Items: Pot, MeasuringCup
# Distractor Actions: None
# High-level solution procedure: take measuring cup, put measuring cup in sink, turn on sink, take measuring cup, pour water in measuring cup into pot, repeat till the water in the pot reaches the target volume

```
This code is a text-based simulation that models how to add a certain amount of water to a pot using a measuring cup. The environment is a kitchen, and the task-critical objects are a sink, a measuring cup, a pot, and water. The high-level object classes are Device (Sink) and Container (Sink, MeasuringCup, Pot). The critical properties are volume (Water), max_volume (MeasuringCup, Pot), and contained_volume (MeasuringCup, Pot). The actions are look, inventory, examine, take/put object, and pour liquid into container. The distractor items are Pot and MeasuringCup. The high-level solution procedure is to take the measuring cup, put the measuring cup in the sink, turn on the sink, take the measuring cup, pour water in the measuring cup into the pot, and repeat until the water in the pot reaches the target volume.

The code includes a class for a game object, a class for a container, a class for a liquid, a class for a container with a maximum volume, a class for the world, a class for the agent, and a class for the text game. The game object class has a name, a parent, and a list of contained objects. It also has a dictionary of properties and a list of referents. The container class is a subclass of the game object class and has a maximum volume and a contained volume. The liquid class is a subclass of the game object class and has a volume. The container with a maximum volume class is a subclass of the container class and has a maximum volume. The world class is a subclass of the container class and has a list of all objects in the environment. The agent class is a subclass of the container class and has a list of all objects in the inventory. The text game class has a random number generator, a user answer, the agent/player, the game object tree, a game score, a game over flag, a game won flag, and a last game observation. It also has a method for generating possible actions, a method for interpreting actions, and a method for calculating the game score.

The main program creates a new game, gets a list of valid actions, and prints the task description, initial observation, and possible actions. It then enters a main game loop where the player's action is performed, and the game state is printed. The game loop continues until the game is over.
