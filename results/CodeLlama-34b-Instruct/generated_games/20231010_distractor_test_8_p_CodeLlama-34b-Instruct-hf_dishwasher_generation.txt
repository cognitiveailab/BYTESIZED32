Here is an example of a text-based simulation on the topic of protecting yourself from mosquitoes by putting on mosquito repellant:
```python
# mosquito_repellant.py
# peter jansen (feb 2/2023)

# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to protect yourself from mosquitoes by putting on mosquito repellant.
# Environment: world
# Task-critical Objects: Room, MosquitoRepellant, Bottle, Box, Apple
# High-level object classes: Containerï¼ˆRoom, Bottle, Box)
# Critical properties: has_mosquito (Room), use_mosquito_repellant (Agent), bit_by_mosquito (Agent)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, move to room, use mosquito repellant
# Distractor Items: None
# Distractor Actions: eat apple
# High-level solution procedure: take bottle containing mosquito repellant, use mosquito repellant, move to forest, take apple, move to house, put apple in box
