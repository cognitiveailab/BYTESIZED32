Here is an example of a text-based simulation on the topic of lighting an LED:
```python
# led.py
# based on bird-life-cycle.py
# ruoyao wang (feb 8/2023)

# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to lit an LED.
# Environment: workshop
# Task-critical Objects: LED, Wire, Battery
# High-level object classes: ElectricalObject (LED, Wire, Battery)
# Critical properties: connects (ElectricalObject), is_conductive (ElectricalObject), on (LED)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, connect X terminal A to Y terminal B
# Distractor Items: ElectricalObject
# Distractor Actions: None
# High-level solution procedure: connect battery anode to LED anode with a wire, connect battery cathode to LED cathode with a wire

This code is a text-based simulation that models how to lit an LED. The player must connect the battery anode to the LED anode with a wire, and the battery cathode to the LED cathode with a wire. The game is won when the LED is lit.

The code is based on the bird-life-cycle.py example, and it uses the same abstract classes and functions as that example. The main differences are in the `initializeWorld` function, which creates a workshop with a table and a drawer, and the `generatePossibleActions` function, which generates actions for connecting objects. The `actionConnect` function is also new, and it connects two objects if they are both conductive and not already connected.

The `step` function is also modified to handle the new actions, and the `calculateScore` function is modified to check if the LED is lit.

The `main` function is also modified to print the task description and the initial observation, and to get a list of valid actions.

This code is a simple example of how to create a text-based simulation using the abstract classes and functions provided in the bird-life-cycle.py example. It can be modified and expanded to create more complex simulations.
