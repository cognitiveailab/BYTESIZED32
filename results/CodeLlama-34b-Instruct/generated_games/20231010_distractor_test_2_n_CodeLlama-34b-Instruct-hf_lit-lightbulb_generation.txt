Here is an example of a text-based simulation on the topic of adding water to a pot using a measuring cup:
```python
# add_water.py
# based on conductivity.py
# ruoyao wang (Mar 05/2023)

# Task Description: Create a micro-simulation that models how to add certain amount of water into a pot using a measuring cup.
# Environment: kitchen
# Task-critical Objects: Sink, MeasuringCup, Pot, Water
# High-level object classes: Device (Sink), Container (Sink, MeasuringCup, Pot) 
# Critical properties: volume (Water), max_volume (MeasuringCup, Pot), contained_volume (MeasuringCup, Pot)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, pour liquid into container
# Distractor Items: Pot, MeasuringCup
# Distractor Actions: None
# High-level solution procedure: take measuring cup, put measuring cup in sink, turn on sink, take measuring cup, pour water in measuring cup into pot, repeat till the water in the pot reaches the target volume

This code creates a text-based simulation where the player must add 1000 ml of water to a pot using a measuring cup. The player can look around the environment, examine objects, take objects, put objects in containers, and pour liquid from one container to another. The game is won when the pot contains 1000 ml of water.
