Here is an example of a text-based simulation on the topic of keeping warm and navigating to another house in a cold winter day:
```python
# winter_day.py
# based on thermometer.py
# ruoyao wang (Mar 2/2023)

# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to keep warm, go outside and navigate to another house in a cold winter day
# Environment: world
# Task-critical Objects: Room, Clothes
# High-level object classes: Container (Room)
# Critical properties: cold (Room), cold_resistance (Clothes), warmth (Agent)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, put on clothes, move
# Distractor Items: Clothes, Room
# Distractor Actions: None
# High-level solution procedure: take down coat, put on down coat, move outside, find a way to another house

This code is a text-based simulation that models how to keep warm and navigate to another house in a cold winter day. The game is set in a world with multiple rooms, each with a different temperature. The player must navigate to the room with the target temperature and put on clothes with the highest cold resistance to keep warm. The game ends when the player is in the target room or when the player runs out of moves.

The game has the following objects:

* Room: A container that has a temperature property.
* Clothes: An object that has a cold resistance property.
* Agent: A container that represents the player.

The game has the following actions:

* Look around: Show the description of the world.
* Inventory: Display the player's inventory.
* Examine: Examine an object.
* Take: Take an object from a container.
* Put: Put an object in a container.
* Move: Move an object from one container to another.

The game has the following properties:

* Cold: The temperature of the room.
* Cold resistance: The cold resistance of the clothes.
* Warmth: The player's warmth level.

The game has the following distractor objects:

* Clothes: Distractors that have a low cold resistance.
* Room: Distractors that have a low temperature.

The game has the following distractor actions:

* None.

The game has the following high-level solution procedure:

1. Take down coat.
2. Put on down coat.
3. Move outside.
4. Find a way to another house.

The game has the following reward function:

* The reward is 1 if the player is in the target room and has the highest cold resistance.
* The reward is 0 otherwise.

The game ends when the player is in the target room or when the player runs out of moves.
