# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to buy a snack from a vending machine with some coins
# Environment: room
# Task-critical Objects: VendingMachine, Coin, Snack
# High-level object classes: Device (VendingMachine), Container (VendingMachine)
# Critical properties: price (Snack), value (Coin), total_money_received (VendingMachine)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, reset, select snack 
# Distractor Items: Snack
# Distractor Actions: None
# High-level solution procedure: select snack, put enough coins into the vending machine, take the snack
