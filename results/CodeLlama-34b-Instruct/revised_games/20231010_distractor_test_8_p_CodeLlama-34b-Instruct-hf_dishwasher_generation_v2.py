This code is a text-based simulation of a game where an agent can move between rooms and use a bottle to apply mosquito repellant. The `Container` class is a base class for `Room` and `Bottle`, which are both subclasses of `GameObject`. The `Agent` class represents the player character.

The code has several issues:

1. The `Container` class is not defined.
2. The `Room` class has a typo in the `moveAgentToRoom` method. It should be `move_agent_to_room`.
3. The `Bottle` class has a typo in the `useMosquitoRepellant` method. It should be `use_mosquito_repellant`.
4. The `Agent` class has a typo in the `removeSelfFromContainer` method. It should be `remove_self_from_container`.
5. The `main` function has several typos in the method calls. It should be `move_to_room`, `make_description_str`, and `use_mosquito_repellant`.

Here is the corrected code:
