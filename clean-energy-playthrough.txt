Task Description: Your task is to change all fossil-fuel power stations to use renewable energy while keeping the same capacity.

Initial Observation: You are in charge of 4 regions. Modify power plants in the regions to use clean energy.
	region 0 has enough sunshine all year round. It has a fossil-fuel power station, whose current generation capasity is 1000kW and is at 100% efficiency.
	region 1 is near a large river. It has a fossil-fuel power station, whose current generation capasity is 1000kW and is at 100% efficiency.
	region 2 is near a large river. It has a fossil-fuel power station, whose current generation capasity is 1000kW and is at 100% efficiency.
	region 3 has steady wind. It has a fossil-fuel power station, whose current generation capasity is 1000kW and is at 100% efficiency.
