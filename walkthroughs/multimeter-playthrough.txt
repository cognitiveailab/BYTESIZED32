Task Description: Your task is to figure out the resistance of the resistor 0.

Initial Observation: You find yourself in a room.  In the room, you see:
	yourself
	a multimeter, which is in voltage mode and reads 0V
	a resistor 0
	a resistor 1
	a red wire
	a black wire
	a blue wire


Type 'help' for a list of possible actions.

> set multimeter to resistance mode
Observaton: You set the multimeter to the resistance mode.

Current step: 1
Score: 0

----------------------------------------
> connect multimeter terminal1 to resistor 0 terminal1
Observaton: Successfully connect multimeter terminal1 to resistor 0 terminal1

Current step: 2
Score: 0
Reward: 0
Game Over: False
Game Won: False

----------------------------------------
> connect multimeter terminal2 to resistor 0 terminal2
Observaton: Successfully connect multimeter terminal2 to resistor 0 terminal2

Current step: 3
Score: 0
Reward: 0
Game Over: False
Game Won: False

----------------------------------------
> look
Observaton: You find yourself in a room.  In the room, you see:
	yourself
	a multimeter, which is in resistance mode and reads 12ohm
	a resistor 0 connecting to multimeter terminal1 and multimeter terminal2
	a resistor 1
	a red wire
	a black wire
	a blue wire


Current step: 4
Score: 0
Reward: 0
Game Over: False
Game Won: False

----------------------------------------
> answer 12 ohm
Observaton: You believe the resistance of the resistor 0 is 12 ohm.
