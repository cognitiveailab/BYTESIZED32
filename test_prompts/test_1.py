# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to heat milk to a temperature that is suitable for a baby using a stove.
# Environment: kitchen
# Task-critical Objects: Stove, Pot, Milk, Fridge, Thermometer
# High-level object classes: Device (Stove, Fridge), Container (Stove, Pot, Fridge) 
# Critical properties: temperature (Milk), temperature_increase_per_tick (Stove), temperature_decrease_per_tick (fridge), max_temperature (Stove), min_temperature (fridge)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, open/close container, turn on/off device, use thermometer on object, feed baby with milk
# Distractor Items: None
# Distractor Actions: drink milk
# High-level solution procedure: open fridge, take pot containing milk, put the pot on the stove, turn on the stove, use the thermometer to moniter the milk temperature till the temperature is suitable for a baby to drink, feed baby
